#### __Talk is cheap! Show me the math!__
This blog collects, refines, and presents math concepts behind machine learning in a minimalistic way.

#### __Some posts are in Chinese?__
Because non-math topics are more enjoyable to write in Chinese to me, 
and don't worry, someday we will have the perfect translator. 
(or you can use the current Google translator; it's very good)

#### __Theme of this blog__
This blog uses a modified Jekyll Minima theme:
