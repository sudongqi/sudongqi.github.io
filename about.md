#### __Talk is cheap! Show me the math!__
This blog collects, refines, and presents math concepts behind machine learning in a minimalistic way.

#### __Other topics__
I plan to write more posts related to NLU and PCG as I started to manage my time better recently.

#### __Languages__
Sometimes I write in Chinese because Chinese is my native language. 
To me, writing in Chinese will always be more comfortable and more natural. 
That being said, I prefer to write in English for more technical topics.

#### __Theme of this blog__
A modified Jekyll Minima theme:
